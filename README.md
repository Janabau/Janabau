- 👋 Hi, I’m @Janabau and I work at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
- 👀 I’m interested in #MissingMaps, digital communications and community engagement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set up blogs on Github and manage mapping tasks on HOT Tasking Manager.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reporting user issues on Tasking Manager, resolving them together and improving the Missing Maps communications.
- 📫 How to reach me? Via hotosm slack or by e-mail: jana.bauerova@prague.msf.org .
